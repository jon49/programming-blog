I am currently working on a time card that will allow the user to track their time in Excel. This will allow the user to choose multiple projects at once and produce charts as a great visual to see how you are working.

After that I will work on my advanced find in VB.NET.

The long term project is the spreadsheet budget in Excel. This project is expected for first release in mid 2012.
