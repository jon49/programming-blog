Just a quick update. I should be putting out the new Excel Time Card by the end of this week or early next week. This will be a big update. Including the following:

<ul>
	<li>Dashboard redesign (and Staging Area)
<ul>
	<li>easily change jobs on chart</li>
<li>easily change settings on dashboard</li>
	<li>filter jobs on chart, e.g., you have TimeCard and TimeCard:Marketing, you can just put TimeCard* to include both on the same screen</li>


</ul>
<li>The template is now included in the program, so no need to download it</li>
</li>
<li>I'm testing out a new updater so you can have secure and smaller packaged updates.</li>
</ul>

I have more plans for the future of the time card - I'll let you know when I get close to finishing them.
