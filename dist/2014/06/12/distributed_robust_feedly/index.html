The more people that follow a blog the more robust its feed will become.</p><p>On the back end all feedly would need to do is periodically update the feeds and user data - but the user data will only need to be updated if a user changes their password. If they have a read-write key for their data then it can be updated only locally and then propogated. The more devices a user uses the more robust their data will become.</p><p>It will be nice when the internet will catch up with the distributed model of doing things.</p><p><a href="/images/FeedlyApp.png"><img src="/images/small/FeedlyApp.png" alt="A Simple Outline of How to Set Up a Distributed Feedly" /></a></p><p>A Simple Outline of How to Set Up a Distributed Feedly</p></article> <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
