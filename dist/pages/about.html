<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>I’m a self-taught programmer looking for some work in Arizona or any telecommuting job would be fine too!</p>
<p>I started with VBA programming in Excel and then moved over to the .NET world, ending with F# (great language). But then I started learning JavaScript and am now a “front-end developer” looking for work. I prefer functional-style programming with libraries like <code>bilby.js</code> and <code>lodash.js</code>.</p>
<p>This blog was written from scratch with <code>mithril.js</code>, <code>gulp.js</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>.</p>
<p>I live in sunny Arizona and have three wonderful children and a loving wife.</p>
