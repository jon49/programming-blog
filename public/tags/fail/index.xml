      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rondebruin.nl/win/s7/win001.htm&#34;&gt;Ron de Bruin&amp;rsquo;s file zipping (and sending) code with Excel&lt;/a&gt;. It works great with a few tweaks. Unfortunately when someone is using a USB drive with their workbook on it it fails to work. So warning: Make sure the users are using it on the main computer when trouble shooting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attempted to Read or Write Protected Memory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on switching over to a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; machine (more on that in a new post). In the process my time card program stopped working with the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;System.AccessViolationException was unhandled
Message: Attempted to read or write protected memory.
This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this error doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up until well after it occurs. So you need to make some educated guesses as to where it is coming from. So what I did is I just commented out code one at a time in the procedure where it was originating from. The code that was shown to be problematic was called from two different places - so the error occurred only from one of the branches but not the other. So that was a bit confusing. It was also confusing because it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen on my Windows XP computer, just on the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; Windows 8 computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I figured out (with help from &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/q/8779557/632495&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;) that it was caused by changing the values of my drop down list during the click event of the combo box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix the problem, &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952544&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; recommends that you don&amp;rsquo;t change the values of the combo box during the event. So, I added a &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h1c2h276(v=vs.85).aspx&#34;&gt;timer component&lt;/a&gt; to the form. The timer allows you to call a function in the future after completing other operations. I also use a timer in the Scribble Filter preview box when someone selects multiple lines on the form - so Excel doesn&amp;rsquo;t go crazy will I&amp;rsquo;m selected the corresponding rows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Copying and pasting is great for coding, but sometimes it can be pretty silly if you make a mistake in the code. Hereâ€™s a triple copy/paste fail (the values should be set to true):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-vbscript&#34;&gt;Public Sub SheetActivate_Dashboard(ByVal sh As Object)

    Try
        gXLApp.EnableEvents = False
        OpenTimeStamp()
    Finally
        gXLApp.EnableEvents = False
    End Try

End Sub

Public Sub SheetDeActivate_Dashboard(ByVal sh As Object)

    Try
        gXLApp.EnableEvents = False
        If Not gfTimeStamp Is Nothing Then
            gfTimeStamp.Visible = False
            gfTimeStamp.Close()
            gfTimeStamp = Nothing
        End If
    Finally
        gXLApp.EnableEvents = False
    End Try

End Sub

Public Sub DoubleClick_Dashboard()

    Try
        gXLApp.EnableEvents = False
        OpenTimeStamp()
    Finally
        gXLApp.EnableEvents = False
    End Try

End Sub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
