      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html&#34;&gt;Bit Torrent Sync&lt;/a&gt; (BT
Sync) is great software which can be used for syncing files. I use it
for backing up all my pictures/videos/music/files/mobile computers.
Well, I did some testing and it looks like it can be used for installing
and updating software also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested it with my Windows 8 computer over to my Windows XP computer. I
created an Excel xla add-in file and I also created an executable file.
Both worked fine after syncing. The following procedure was used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create folder for program you would like synced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync/get-started.html&#34;&gt;Create a syncing
folder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy read only secret

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;right click on folder to sync in BT Sync “Show folder
preferences” then copy read only secret&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Careful not to copy the wrong folder! You don’t want others
getting your data!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the secret to all those that you would like to have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BT Sync could probably work for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This seems like a good idea for open source projects which are free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could probably also work for paid products which allow for
updates for a year or more. For paid products a developer could just
create a new folder after the latest cutoff period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might be ideal for corporate wide add-ins also. The main
problem with that is security of course. So I am not quite sure how
that would be worked out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The down side would be that for people which don’t want to install BT
Sync you would need a back up updater/installer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think! It would be interesting to hear other ideas
on how this could work in the programming environment &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.bittorrent.com/tag/bittorrent-sync/&#34;&gt;which haven’t
already been thought
of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
