I'm a self-taught programmer looking for some work in Arizona or any
telecommuting job would be fine too!

I started with VBA programming in Excel and then moved over to the .NET
world, ending with F\# (great language). But then I started learning
JavaScript and am now a "front-end developer" looking for work. I prefer
functional-style programming with libraries like `bilby.js` and
`lodash.js`.

This blog was written from scratch with `mithril.js`, `gulp.js`, and
`pandoc`.

I live in sunny Arizona and have three wonderful children and a loving
wife.
