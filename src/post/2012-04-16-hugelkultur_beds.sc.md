When it comes to gardening, I have a black thumb. But every year I try as I might to garden again. Last year I tried mixing some wood and branches into my square boxes inspired from the [hugelkultur bed design](http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/). This seemed to have a positive effect on my garden and helped it retain water better.

So this year, I'm at it again, but on a bigger scale.

<p>8 feet by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep pit for wood.</p>

<p>All the logs put in the pit. About 4 feet tall.</p>

I've since put dirt on it and am now in the process of putting compost on it. Once I get the new pictures on my computer I'll update this post on how this endeavor is going.
