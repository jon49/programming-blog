In addiction to the Excel Time Card you can use these:

The time card is my pilot program to learn how to do the <a href="">personal finance add-in</a> better. I chose not to charge for the time card simply because there are already many time tracking things out there, like  <a href="http://slimtimer.com/">SlimTimer</a> (if I needed one for on the go I would probably use this one, nice and clean and easy to use), <a href="https://www.clicktime.com/">ClickTime</a>, <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> (this one is an interesting concept where it tracts your time for you), and <a href="https://www.timecard.com/">TimeCard.com</a>.

Eventually I would like to make it so you can import the data into the Excel time card, that way, when all you have is your phone you can still track your information.
