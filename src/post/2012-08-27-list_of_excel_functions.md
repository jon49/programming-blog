For the advanced filter I need a list of Excel functions. There are lists, unfortunately I needed the list with the function parameters (syntax). I also wanted it by date. I have lists of just the functions for Excel 2003, 2007, and 2010 without the syntax. So I did some screen scraping of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-functions-by-category-HA102752955.aspx?CTT=1#_Toc309306719">Microsoft's list of Excel functions</a> where I was able to get the function name, category, description, syntax, and website URL for that function.

I thought others might be able to use this list also. Feel free to download it!
