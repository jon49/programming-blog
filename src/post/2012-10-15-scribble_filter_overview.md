-   To get the date spans right click on the left calendar button.
-   Use tab or enter to get the first line from the drop down menu.
-   Right click on buttons to get more options (e.g., right click on
    report button to set type of report to create: On separate sheet,
    preview, in place, chain).
-   Order of precedence is CHAIN, then AND, then OR. Use parentheses if
    you want something ORed first, otherwise it will be ANDed first.
