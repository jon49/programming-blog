The first version of the Scribble filter I thought I shouldn't put out an updatable version. In retrospect that was a mistake, wouldn't I want to update it for bugs? Well, yes I would. So, this newest version is updatable! That's a new lesson for me when putting out applications.

Excel 32-bit (most users)
[wpdm_file id=1]

Excel 64-bit
[wpdm_file id=4]

How have you been liking the Scribble filter? Any questions/comments on its use?
