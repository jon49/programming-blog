I normally don’t deal with very long strings. But I’m working on a
project that requires storing a text file in Excel that I can later
access (it would be nice just to embed it but Excel doesn’t like viruses
– which makes me have to just store it in a worksheet).

So what is the max string length in an array write to an Excel range?

911

Seems kind of random but that is the number. Raise that number to 912
and you’ll get an error.
