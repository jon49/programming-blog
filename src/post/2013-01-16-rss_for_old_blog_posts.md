One of the nice to haves on my list is a way to read old blog posts via RSS. I've found that it is really easy to read someone's old material on their blog if it is drip fed to me. Well, after a little searching on the internet I found <a href="http://www.streamspigot.com/feed-playback/">Stream Spigot's Feed Playback</a>. Now I can enjoy someone's old posts without having to remember to go back every other day or once every week.
