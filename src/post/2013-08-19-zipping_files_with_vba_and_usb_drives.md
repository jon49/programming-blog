I used [Ron de Bruin's file zipping (and sending) code with Excel](http://www.rondebruin.nl/win/s7/win001.htm). It works great with a few tweaks. Unfortunately when someone is using a USB drive with their workbook on it it fails to work. So warning: Make sure the users are using it on the main computer when trouble shooting!
