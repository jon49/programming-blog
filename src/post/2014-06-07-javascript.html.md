I’ve jumped ship from Excel programming over to JavaScript (in a
functional manner). I’ve also gone the way of Linux away from Windows. I
love Excel and its power. But I see the writing on the wall and am
moving to where I can hopefully get some work and starting making some
moolah. You can follow my new blog over at
<http://thisisafiller.ghoster.io/>.\
 If anyone is interested in the products I’ve made let me know how you
like them and [send me an e-mail](http://nymanjon@gmail.com). Or tweet
me [@NymanJon](https://twitter.com/NymanJon).
